Instructions for building the "Poisson" code.
Craig Lage - UC Davis - 18-Feb-15

Dependencies:

There are two dependencies that need to be installed before you can compile the Poisson code:

(1) C++ Boost libraries.  There are several options for installing these:

     (A) Ubuntu: Install the boost libraries using: sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
     (B) Mac OSX: Assuming you are using homebrew, install using: brew install boost
     (C) Build them from source.  They can be downloaded from: www.boost.org

(2) HDF5 libraries.  There are several options for installing these:

     (A) Ubuntu: Install the hdf5 libraries using: sudo apt-get install hdf5-tools
     (B) Mac OSX: Assuming you are using homebrew, install using: brew install hdf5
     (C) Build them from source.  They can be downloaded from: www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html

(3) After installing the above two dependencies, edit the src/Makefile lines BOOST_DIR and HDF5_DIR to point to their locations.

(4) In the src directory, type "make".  This should build the Poisson code, and create an executable called src/Poisson. Depending on where you ahve installed the above libraries, you may need to edit your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so the system can find the appropriate files for linking.
